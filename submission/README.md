Our team is from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and MIT-ADT School of Bioengineering Sciences and Research, Pune. We think proteins are cool, and so are scientists. We are a bunch of modern-day Sherlock Holmes' always on the lookout for new mysteries.

### Project Description

We have worked on the `tcr-pmhc` challenge. This challenge focusses on predicting T-Cell receptor binding with the peptide-MHC 
(Major Histocompatability Complex-1). Here we have used a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to predict the binding. We argue that CNN extracts the 
positional information and LSTM extracts the sequential information present in the receptor sequence, peptide and MHC sequences. 
Our mode gives test MCC of ~0.534. with validation MCC of 0.66 and train MCC 0.998.
